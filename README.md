### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I'm Thiago Cabral Correia, front-end web developer, also with mobile development experience.

React.js, Next.js, SASS/CSS/Styled-components and React Native are my main tools in current job, but always available to learn new technologies. 

### ðŸ”§ I've worked with these tools

Before becoming developer, I worked with graphic design. ðŸŽ¨ That's also why I always collaborate with UI/UX and designers to deliver work effectively.

Code and coffee are my passions. I like to collaborate, make connections, be part of a team and grow together.
